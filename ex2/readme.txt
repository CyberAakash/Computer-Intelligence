Certainly! Here's an explanation of the `a_star_search()` function line by line:

```python
def a_star_search(self, start_node, goal_node):
    if start_node not in self.nodes or goal_node not in self.nodes:
        print("One or both of the nodes do not exist.")
        return None, float('inf')
```
- This function takes the `start_node` and `goal_node` as input parameters.
- It checks if both the `start_node` and `goal_node` exist in the graph's set of nodes (`self.nodes`).
- If either of them is missing, it prints an error message and returns `None` and `float('inf')` (infinity) as the shortest path and cost.

```python
open_set = [(0, start_node)]  # Priority queue: (f_score, node)
closed_set = set()
g_scores = {node: float('inf') for node in self.nodes}
g_scores[start_node] = 0
f_scores = {node: float('inf') for node in self.nodes}
f_scores[start_node] = self.heuristics[start_node]
```
- It initializes the `open_set` as a priority queue using a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the `f_score` and the corresponding `node`.
- The `f_score` represents the estimated total cost of the path from the start node to the goal node passing through the current node.
- The `closed_set` is initialized as an empty set to keep track of nodes that have been fully evaluated.
- The `g_scores` dictionary is initialized with all nodes having a value of infinity, except for the `start_node`, which is set to 0.
- The `f_scores` dictionary is also initialized with all nodes having a value of infinity, except for the `start_node`, which is set to the heuristic value of the `start_node`.

```python
while open_set:
    current_f, current_node = heapq.heappop(open_set)
```
- The algorithm enters a loop that continues as long as there are nodes in the `open_set` priority queue.
- In each iteration, it selects the node with the minimum `f_score` from the `open_set` using the `heappop()` function from the `heapq` module.
- The `current_f` represents the `f_score` of the selected node, and `current_node` represents the node itself.

```python
if current_node == goal_node:
    return self._reconstruct_path(goal_node, g_scores), g_scores[goal_node]
```
- After selecting a node, it checks if the `current_node` is equal to the `goal_node`.
- If they are equal, it means that the goal node has been reached, and it calls the `_reconstruct_path()` method to reconstruct the shortest path and returns the path and the cost (the `g_score` of the `goal_node`).

```python
closed_set.add(current_node)
```
- If the goal node has not been reached, it adds the `current_node` to the `closed_set` to mark it as fully evaluated.

```python
if current_node in self.edges:
    neighbors = self.edges[current_node].keys()
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        tentative_g = g_scores[current_node] + self.edges[current_node][neighbor]
        if tentative_g < g_scores[neighbor]:
            g_scores[neighbor] = tentative_g
            f_scores[neighbor] = g_scores[neighbor] + self.heuristics[neighbor]
            if neighbor not in closed_set:
                heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_scores[neighbor], neighbor))
```
- It checks if the `current_node` has neighbors in the graph.
- If there are neighbors, it iterates over each neighbor.
- For each neighbor, it calculates the tentative `g_score` by adding the cost of the edge from the `current_node` to the neighbor (`self.edges[current_node][neighbor]`) to the `g_score` of the `current_node`.
- If the tentative `g_score` is lower than the `g_score` of the `neighbor`, it means that a shorter path to the `neighbor` has been found.
- In that case, it updates the `g_score` and `f_score` of the `neighbor` accordingly.
- If the `neighbor` is not in the `closed_set`, it means it hasn't been fully evaluated yet, so it is added to the `open_set` priority queue.

```python
return None, float('inf')
```
- If the goal node is not found within the loop, it means there is no path from the `start_node` to the `goal_node`.
- In that case, the function returns `None` as the shortest path and `float('inf')` (infinity) as the cost.

That's the line-by-line explanation of the `a_star_search()` function. It performs the A* search algorithm by evaluating nodes and updating the scores until the goal node is reached or no path is found.
